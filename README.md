# Rock-Paper-Scissors



I used Javafx buttons in order to have the user pick between rock, paper or scissors. In addition, I have a restart button, if 
user wants to play again and a start button that is clicked once the user has chosen an option. In addition, I decided to use 
enums in order to have a better understanding of the option that the computer chose vs. the option that the user chose. Due 
to this easy distinction the conditions were easy to make to distiguish whether the game resulted in a tie, a win or a loss.
